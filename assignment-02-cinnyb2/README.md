# Roman numerals flowchart

### Decomposition	
-	Break down the system of how roman numerals are counted compared to the arabic system and reformulate it as a mathematical equation
### Automating with Algorithms
-	Provide detailed instructions and special cases so that function will work for all numbers up to 1000.
### Pattern Matching
- Look for core patterns in the roman counting system and the edge case to make the function more robust
### Abstraction
- Ignore small details such as the fact that the algorithm will not work for edge case, and instead add them into your dictionary rather than create a new mathematical equation that is inclusive of all cases.

# Seconds flowchart

### Decomposition
-	total_seconds store the value of all four parameters which are separated by parenthesis, and each parenthesis has its encase its own operation onto the argument given
### Pattern Matching
-	The pattern for each of the four operation is the same as it has the same concept of multiplying an argument by the number of seconds that parameter has 
### Abstraction
-	The function ignores whether the argument enter is positive or negative but just calculates based on equation given
### Automating with Algorithms
-	If a valid integer input is provided, the program will always output to correct number of seconds

# Peanut butter jam sandwich flowchart

### Decomposition
-	The steps on how to create a peanut butter jam sandwich stay constant but the number of steps can increase depending on how much spread a user wants
-	The basic recipe composed of jam, peanut butter, and bread will always stay consistent
### Abstraction
-	Regardless of whether the user will choose olive bread or sour rye, or how much jam and peanut butter they want, the program will always create a peanut butter jam sandwich
### Pattern Matching
-	The "choosing the type of bread and jam" prompt both have the same pattern
-	Both peanut butter and jam dollop prompt follow the same pattern 
### Automating with Algorithm
-	Well-defined algorithm that will create the perfect peanut butter jam sandwich to each userâ€™s taste
-	The loop will add more peanut butter/jam depending on input
