# How to fold an airplane flowchart

### Decomposition	
-	Breaking down how to create an airplane from a piece of paper step by step
### Automating with Algorithms
-	Provide well-defined instructions that will output the exact same airplane every time
### Pattern Matching
-	At the lowest level it can be broken down to fold and unfolding a piece of paper

# Fibonacci sequence flowchart

### Decomposition
-	Each variable will either perform smaller arithmetic operations or store important values, so it is possible to concatenated them later to create dynamic formula that changes depending on input
### Pattern Matching
-	Similarities between the structure of how to find the first Fibonacci sequence value and the nth value, allows for the repetitive calculation until the nth value is reached
### Abstraction
-	The flowchart ignores the details surrounding all the Fibonacci numbers and is only concerned with last two Fibonacci numbers before the input nth value.
-	The flowchart only focuses on the fact that the formula to find the nth Fibonacci number is the same
### Automating with Algorithms
-	If a valid integer input is provided, the program will always output to correct nth value of the Fibonacci sequence by following the conditions and arguments outlined by the flowchart

# Peanut butter jam sandwich flowchart

### Decomposition
-	The steps on how to create a peanut butter jam sandwich stay constant but the number of steps can increase depending on how much spread a user wants
-	The basic recipe composed of jam, peanut butter, and bread will always stay consistent
### Abstraction
-	Regardless of whether the user will choose olive bread or sour rye, or how much jam and peanut butter they want, the program will always create a peanut butter jam sandwich
### Pattern Matching
-	The "choosing the type of bread and jam" prompt both have the same pattern
-	Both peanut butter and jam dollop prompt follow the same pattern 
### Automating with Algorithm
-	Well-defined algorithm that will create the perfect peanut butter jam sandwich to each userâ€™s taste
-	The loop will add more peanut butter/jam depending on input
